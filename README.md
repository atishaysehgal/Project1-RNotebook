### [Project Description](doc/)

What makes you happy? A question which, in my opinion, yields different answers at different stages of life. If I was a **kid**(1-12 years old), I would probably have an innocent, goofy answer. If I was a **teenager**(13-19 years old), I'd probably have some rebel-without-a-cause answer. If I was a **middle aged** (36-59 years old) person, I'd probably have a family which I would talk about. If I was an **Old Timer**(60+ years old), I'd probably just want to talk about my family, friends, and also talk about my life that went by. But hey, I might be completely wrong! There's nothing to backup my intuition. Let's find out what makes people happy at different stages of life. To make it personal and hopefully relatable, let's find out what makes people happy in **different parts of the world** at different stages of life.
